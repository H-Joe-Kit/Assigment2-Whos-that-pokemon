who's that pokemon vscode

This program is using html to create a website for a game called "Who's that pokemon?"
In the game, the player will see a shadow of a pokemon and has to guess which pokemon it is.
Players can also select difficulty since some pokemon shadows look very similar(hard mode) and some pokemon are very well-known(easy)
