who's that pokemon vscode

This program is using html to create a website for a game called "Who's that pokemon?"

In the game, the player will see a shadow of a pokemon and has to guess which pokemon it is.


#Design Process


#Features 
There will be 2 gamemodes, both gamemodes have time limits

Gamemode1(Quickguess): The game but players can see the clear picture of the pokemon instead of the shadow but an extremely short time to guess.

Gamemode2(Shadows): The game where players can only see the shadow.

Players can also select difficulty. 
Quickguess

Easy: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of a separate list of pokemon that are very well-known, making it easier to guess, time limit per guess is 7 seconds.

Normal: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of the whole list of pokemon, time limit per guess is 5 seconds.

Hard: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of a separate list of pokemon that are not so well-known, making it harder to guess, time limit per guess is 3 seconds.

Shadows

Easy: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of a separate list of pokemon that are very well-known, making it easier to guess, time limit per guess is 10 seconds.

Normal: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of the whole list of pokemon, time limit per guess is 8 seconds.

Hard: Chooses a RANDOM pokemon out of a separate list of pokemon that shadows look very similar, making it harder to guess, time limit per guess is  seconds.
